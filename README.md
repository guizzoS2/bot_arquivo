        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>The <strong>py_eye</strong> is a Python script designed to collect comprehensive information from computer systems (CPs) and store this data in a .txt file. Initially, <strong>py_eye</strong> is fully operational on Windows platforms, with partial functionality available on Linux systems.</p>
        <p>Its primary purpose is to facilitate the inventory management of computers, users, MAC addresses, and network connections at the Florian√≥polis City Hall. By integrating <strong>py_eye</strong> with a Group Policy Object (GPO) script, it will be deployed across all computers, utilizing a JSON link for data handling.</p>
